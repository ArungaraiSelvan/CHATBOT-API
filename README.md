# Chatbot - API using Python

Welcome to the Chatbot - API project repository! This project is aimed at creating a chatbot application with an API interface using Python.

## Overview
This project utilizes Python to develop a chatbot capable of interacting with users through a variety of platforms such as messaging applications, websites, or other software. The chatbot is designed to understand natural language queries and provide appropriate responses based on predefined rules, machine learning algorithms, or other techniques.

## Features
- **API Interface**: Provides an API endpoint for interaction with the chatbot.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilizes NLP techniques to understand user queries.
- **Response Generation**: Generates responses based on input queries.
- **Customization**: Allows customization of chatbot behavior and responses.
- **Scalability**: Designed to be scalable for handling large volumes of requests.
